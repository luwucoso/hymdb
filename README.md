# Welcome to the Hytale Mod Database!

HYMDB is a lightweight, open and community-maintained index of _Hytale_ mods.

Our goal is to make browsing mods slightly easier during early access, when the modding ecosystem is very fragmented.

> [!NOTE]
> Because hytale has not yet released, we are still trying to figure out how modding works in the first place!

## What is in this repository?
This repository is simply a collection of JSON files that index mods for hytale. And to keep things simple, we do not keep any mod files in the repo itself.

Additionally, we also have some python scripts in [`tools/`](./tools/) to help validate the files, and (soon enough) a github action on PRs aswell. All scripts follow the schema on [`schemas/`](./schemas/), even though it is not frozen yet and may change in the future.
